# Secrets of Sokol Keep

## Adventure Background

> There always have been stories of treasure on Thorn Island, the isle functioning as a natural breakwater for Phlan’s harbor. The details differ with the teller of the tale. Many have sought the fabled riches of Sokol Keep, but nobody has ever claimed it, or at least admits to doing so. Now most believe it has been found long ago or that it is just a myth; one of many that surrounds Phlan. In the decades that the keep was an abandoned ruin, there certainly has been ample of time for adventurers to scour the island. When House Sokol assumed control of the island, they never professed having found any treasure when they restored, and later extended, the keep. And they never looked very kindly on treasure seekers intruding upon their property and stead-fastedly blocked any thorough search of the keep in the century that they have been its custodian. Having been forced to mostly leave the island recently due to the troubles in the city, there would be little the House could do about any uninvited guests.

> Still, Sokol Keep’s lighthouse is a reliable source of income for the house and important to the city’s maritime trade and defense. So the family left a token few retainers to maintain the fortress and ensure that the beacon was operational. Leading this small group was the young Igan Sokol, a junior member of the family. In addition, the Black Fist has a small squad of soldiers at the Keep to ostensibly help with defense.  Well aware that his job was a kind of banishment, Igan thought that finding the fabled treasure would bring him back into good graces with his demanding parents. An opportunistic Black Fist soldier, Guard Sergeant Grim Thornbuck, befriended him and provided the young quartermaster with motivation to continue his search.

> Unlike any previous treasure hunters, Igan had one huge advantage. Igan had been raised at the Keep, and at a young age he had found a well-hidden shrine of Tyr—long since forgotten. He restored it and maintained it ever since. Unbeknownst to others, the shrine was haunted by the spirit of a female cleric of Tyr, named Harae. The spirit knew of the treasure below the keep, and wanted to reward the young man for his dedication to the shrine. Hardly more than the sheerest presence, she was unable to truly interact with the world beyond moving small items around. Nevertheless, moving the right books and opening them to the correct pages was all that it took.  With the help of the spirit, Grim, and the other Black Fist guards, Igan found the hidden caverns beneath the keep and the expected treasure within. Upon seeing it, Igan thought the treasure to be evil, and wanted it destroyed. But greed overcame Grim and the other soldiers. Grim murdered Igan and had hoped to set sail in the night, but the murder awoke the long dormant guardians of the temple, trapping Grim and his coconspirators in the dungeon below. In the spirit’s anger and sadness, Harae	disabled the lighthouse, hoping that she would catch the attention of adventurers who would come and recover Igan’s body, arrest the murderers, and cleanse the island of undead for good.  Lured by rumors of treasure and locals beseeching the characters to restore the beacon, the characters now have to explore the island to find out what happened and bring the murders to justice.

## Overview

The adventure starts with the characters visiting the **Laughing Goblin**, one of the more famous taverns at the docks. The news about the extinguished beacon atop Sokol Keep is the topic de jour. Before the characters can investigate further, **a group of dockworkers confronts two mercenaries**; personal friends of some of the Black Fist guards assigned to the Keep. The confrontation is unlikely to go well and ends up in a tavern brawl if the characters don’t intervene. After the fight, **the characters learn a bit more about events and are asked by the locals to investigate**, since the authorities care more about politics than solving the issue.
At **Sokol Keep** the characters can interact with **the servants**, potentially **a spirit** and search through the possessions of **Igan and the Black Fist guards** to get an idea of what happened.
The information leads them to the West Tower and the now obvious closed entrance of an until-recently hidden area below the keep. Assuming the characters have found the right clues, they can easily open it and go down. Otherwise it requires more work.
The hidden area is a long-forgotten, **subterranean temple** dedicated to some unknown entity that predates the existence of the Keep. It is wet and muddy. In the central area of worship the characters find **Igan’s body as well as a group of skeletal guardians** that seem to have animated as a result of the guards’s defilement of the temple. Within the hidden temple, they also find the **Black Fist soldiers who are desperate to leave**. Depending on how the characters react, the Black Fist might face them in combat or peacefully surrender.  With the capture of the Black Fist and the discovery of Igan’s body, the adventure ends. All the characters have to do now is think about what to tell the world.

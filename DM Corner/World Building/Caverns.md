ENTRANCES/EXITS

Entering a cavern means making a choice to leave the surface world - not something that should be taken lightly. In my opinion, caverns are not easy to enter, and they are not easy to escape. If its just a simple hole in the side of mountain, then where's the mystery and challenge in that?

**Every cavern's entrance is a signature. A special quality that it shares with none other.**

-   The Cavern at Fellmouth rock is only accessible by rappelling down a 300' sinkhole that's dotted with Stirge nests and small plagues of Mites.
    
-   The Glittering Dome is just that, a huge open cave that sparkles in the torchlight, but there are 37 tunnels leading out of it, most in the floor, and 3 (some argue 4) out of the ceiling.
    
-   The Caverns at Dunson Moor are halfway up the side of the eastern face of the Shatterjack Mountains and the only safe way up the cliff is a closely guarded secrets among the local tribes, who believe the Caverns are a sacred place.
    
-   The Maw of Golovkin can only be accessed by climbing to the top of Frogdrop Mountain and then down over the side where high winds and storms often buffet the hapless traveler. The local Galeb Duhr often block those in whom they sense greed and bloodlust.
    

By creating a signature entrance then you've instantly created something memorable. Something that is a _challenge_ in and of itself. If the party strolls, hand-in-hand, in a nicely leveled cavern neatly situated in the base of a mountain, then that's not the least bit memorable, that's just dull.

Similarly, the way _out_ of a cavern should not be easy. There are no Exit signs. Perhaps you need to scale a 200' chimney to escape. Or pass through an icy cold waterfall guarded by Mud Mephits. Or perhaps you can only go down for miles before you can come up and out again. Give your caverns a sense of awe and wonder. Your party will thank you for it (although they may not say so in so many words, they'll damn sure remember it!)

TERRAIN/HAZARDS

Crawling through a cavern system blind is supremely dangerous. Even today, people are killed every year while caving (and underwater caving is 1000% more dangerous). The system itself is an adversary. Treat is as such.

Tunnels and individual caverns shouldn't be level and straight. Imagine a huge piece of string, balled up. Now imagine trying to navigate this insanity while chittering things in the darkness are trying to eat your face off. Caverns are _dangerous_.

Here are some hazards:

-   Passageways that are too small to crawl into, but tiny monsters have no problem traversing.
    
-   Tunnels that go straight up. Or straight down. And then curve. And then dead end. There are lots and lots of these. Their purpose? To waste time and food (and water) and to exhaust and frustrate the party, so when the monsters come, they are frazzled, low on resources, and ripe for terror.
    
-   Passages blocked by water. Or cave-ins. Or lava. Or ice. Or whatever.
    
-   Passages that you can crawl through, but not without dumping some gear. This is a **big** one. Do you dump that shield or do you turn back towards the Hook Horrors that you failed to dispatch? I have been in many, many caverns where I had to dump gear. Hell, sometimes I had to dump _armor_. Yeah, it sucked, but you know what? 20 years later I still remember it. That's what you are aiming for. Something that will resonate in gamer tales down through the ages.
    
-   Volcanic passages that can cause severe burns to exposed flesh. Hot air is hard to breathe as well. Thin walls where lava can come spilling out if hit with a fumbled attack.
    
-   Poisonous water. Stagnant pools are often toxic, but leave some fresh (filtered) water in places if you are feeling magnanimous.
    
-   Molds and fungi, even "real world" ones are always a threat. Spores can cause hallucinations, poison, or fatigue (among many other effects).
    
-   Running water is cold and can be dangerous. Waterfalls and deep running streams fill areas with white noise. Perfect ambush territory.
    
-   Think in 3D. Ledges and passages can be high up on walls. Pits and holes can descend for hundreds of feet. Tiny cracks everywhere are the perfect nesting grounds for tiny bastards like [Jermlaine, Snyads and Mites](http://www.halfblogre.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Size-Comparison.gif).
    
-   Constant wind on cold, hungry bones can be maddening, and disguise the sounds of chitinous feet on rock.
    
-   Rockfalls and unstable floors are a constant threat and can cause the party to lose their way and make their maps useless if they are suddenly on another level.
    

**Don't be afraid to make your caverns feel like a twisted tangle of string, underground, with little rhyme or reason as to the layout of the tunnels and chambers.** These types of caverns actually exist. They are called "spongework" and they look like a sponge, full of holes and connecting passages that defy mapping in 2d. Be creative! Check Wikipedia for cavern systems and then look up the real-world maps of them. They can bring endless inspiration.

ECOLOGIES

There are around 50 official WoTC 5th edition monsters that **could** make their lair underground. With the addition of [Fifth Edition Foes](https://www.froggodgames.com/fifth-edition-foes) and the [Tome of Beasts](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-beasts-for-5th-edition/) that list balloons to well over a hundred. I'll only list the WoTC ones for this post.

Monster Roles

I tried to create some categories, just to get some groups of creatures that we can tell, at a glance, how they will interact with the world. These are only EXAMPLES, so feel free to create your own or ignore/amend this list completely.

-   Swarm: These creatures attack with overwhelming numbers
    
-   Scavenger: These creatures only attack wounded or solo creatures
    
-   Ambusher: These creatures rely on surprise to incapacitate or kill
    
-   Solo Predator: These creatures are fierce enough to hunt alone (but include family)
    
-   Pack: A group of 1-4 creatures who hunt together
    
-   Clan: A group of 2-8 creatures who survive together
    
-   Tribe: A group of 8-64 creatures who live together
    
-   Non-Aggressive: These creatures are only aggressive if attacked
    

Habitation Reasons

Its good to get into the habit of trying to determine _why_ these creatures are here. This is a quick list and are only EXAMPLES. Feel free to amend as you see fit.

1.  Breeding/Surviving (aw yiss)
    
2.  Guarding a treasure (a personal hoard or on behalf of another creature)
    
3.  Gathering resources (food, slaves, minerals, plants, etc...)
    
4.  Raiding the surface/Underdark (food, slaves, treasure, etc...)
    
5.  Servants of another Master (creature or NPC)
    
6.  Temporary housing/Emergency shelter (outcasts/exiles, wartime, migrants, etc...)
    
7.  Escaped from servitude (creature or NPC)
    
8.  War with another species (or more)
    
9.  Permanent home (settlers)
    
10.  Guarding a secret (magical, physical, other)
    
11.  Trapped here (ghosts and prisoners)
    
12.  Following another species to scavenge from (plenty of these in D&D)
    

Number Appearing

This long-standing statistic was removed from the Monster Manual. The new regime of building by CR, I assume. Personally I like the idea of a common number of these creatures appearing, with DM's right-to-change of course, because it gives me a sense of what I have on my hands. Is it a nest? Or a full colony? A few scouts? Or a whole battalion?

**These numbers are completely arbitrary, and can be changed to whatever fits your DM style**

BUILDING THE ECOLOGIES

I like to roll 4-6 creatures on the list, and then sit for a minute and try and understand the situation. This, for me, brings the ecologies to life and gives a sense of movement and purpose beyond waiting to get slaughtered by adventurers.

The predator species are going to have some space between them, some lookouts to watch for raids, and some random patrols to check that no one has sneaked past the guards. The opportunistic ones will remain far away from one another, but near to the other species as they can without being discovered. Neither will attack a fully armed party for no reason. They only attack lone individuals, and they hide their kills. They may be hungry monsters, but they have cunning, like all predators do. Don't give away the game.

Remember that intelligent species will try and herd prey into traps or dead ends, where they can be destroyed at leisure. They will call for reinforcements, and they will attack from flanking passageways whenever possible.

I've rolled up a few groups as examples and linked the relevant posts that were done for the "Ecology of the Monster" project. Feel free to ignore those.

---

Group 01 - 4 creatures - The Abandoned Dungeon

-   Ghouls (5)
    
-   Gargoyles (3)
    
-   Kobolds (62)
    
-   Myconids (18)
    

_I look at this spread and I instantly see a state of war. Kobolds vs Myconids, with the Gargoyles and Ghouls harassing them both (and one another)._

[**Ghouls**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3oneep/ghoul/) - They can't be poisoned or charmed, and have that nice paralytic touch, the former protects it from Myconid attacks and the latter is devestating to Kobolds but the Myconids and Gargoyles are immune. There used to be many more of them when the traps confining them finally fell, but predation from the Gargoyles mostly has whittled them down. They are not smart enough to plot or scheme, but they do know when they are outnumbered, and they are not the predators here. They have resorted to hiding and picking off stragglers.

[**Gargoyles**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/38prve/gargoyle/) - Tough, resistant and perpetually pissed off, these outcasts from the Plane of Earth have been the most efficient killers in this eco-system. They shrug off the Myconids and Ghouls special abilities with ease, and nothing in the eco-system can hurt them. They have mainly been stirring up trouble between the Myconids and Kobolds (who were in a semi-homeostatic state before the dungeon's control system failed), and have delighted in watching them tear one another apart. There will be many months of such games ahead of the trio, who have been mostly staying away from one another.

[**Kobolds**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/359ejs/kobolds/) - A huge colony occupies the top and middle levels of the abandoned dungeon. They have been breeding almost unchecked for a few years, and there were well over 200 creatures, and 60 fighters. Nowadays, there are only around 30 fighters. They are dispersed throughout the area, at key checkpoints and outposts. The very brief war with the Myconids has taken its toll, slashing the Kobold numbers in half, and they have only weeks before the Myconid Blooms overwhelm them.

[**Myconids**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3b27xp/myconid/) - This small infestation is low in number, but the Kobolds have no defense from the sporemist, and the corpses of the dead kobolds are now seeding scores of new Myconid blooms. In days there will be hundreds of them.

Group 02 - 5 creatures - The Dragon's Lair

-   Darkmantle (1)
    
-   Shreikers (12)
    
-   Cyclops (1)
    
-   Shadow Dragon (1)
    
-   Stone Giants (2)
    

_This is an unusual one. Many strong creatures. The Dragon has to be the master here. The others in servitude. No conflict here beyond politicking._

[**Darkmantle**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4au5u2/darkmantle/) - This lone predator is a sneaky lackey of the Shadow Dragon who lives here. It randomly lurks in one of the entry tunnels into the larger lair system and picks off the unwary.

[**Shreikers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/38x9cn/shrieker_fungus/) - These are planted all over the entry tunnels to the lair system, and are replanted as they die off by the Stone Giant.

[**Cyclops**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4c3jne/cyclops/) - This sniveling lackey is a true villain. Cruel, capricious, and willful, she fawns obesience to the Stone Giant while constantly plotting his downfall.

[**Stone Giant**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/46593w/stone_giant/) - Humble servant of his master, the Dragon, the Stone Giant is vigilant about security. Traps are dotted all over the entryways as well as the lair itself, with 2 redoubts that would house most of the Dragon's hoard if necessary. His mate does the cooking and hunting, travelling far in the Undertunnels to find game and other squealing delights for the stewpot.

[**Shadow Dragon**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/35u2qm/shadow_dragon/) - A Gold Shadow Dragon obsessed with wealth. This lair is deep underground, far away from any main thoroughfares. There are 18 chambers filled with stolen wealth of every conceivable form. The Dragon was once a Guardian of the Dwarves. But the Dwarves were tricked, and their wealth stolen, replaced with forgeries so cunning not even the Masters of the Forge could detect any wrongdoing. The Dragon discovered the deception, and went on a rampage, tracking down the theives and burning them alive. But in his wrath, his breath destroyed the stolen treasure as well. In his grief, he returned and when he told the Dwarves what had happened they grew enraged and tried to kill him. He defended himself to the last Dwarf. When it was all over, he broke into the Vaults and took the false treasure, believing it to be real, deluded in his grief, he fled underground, and subjugated those living there into his rule. Now he fears all intruders, come to steal his precious hoard.

Group 03 - 6 creatures - Classic Cavern

_A nice mix of classic underground critters...except for the Hobgoblins. What are they doing there?_

-   Hobgoblins (29)
    
-   Rust Monsters (2)
    
-   Crawling Claws (24)
    
-   Roper (1)
    
-   Hook Horrors (6)
    
-   Otyugh (1)
    

[**Hobgoblins**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4bekfk/hobgoblin/) - A large warband of Hobgoblins ([Infiltrators and Warmages](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3ptv0i/humanoid_supplements_hobgoblin_infiltrator_cr_2/) as well as some warrior types) is sheltering in this cavern to tend to their wounded. They have been skirmishing with Orc Raiders for some weeks now, in the local area. This spot has become a favorite camp for both sides, and has some crude amenities - wooden benches and a stone cooking pot the size of a large cathedral bell. They are camped out in some 5 or 6 chambers, connected by a snarl of dead ends and snake pits (dead ends with deep pits at the ends of them). They have done some preliminary recon into the lower sections and have detected the Hook Horrors and the Roper and have sealed the Horrors in with a controlled cave-in. The Rust Monsters have been taken as pets, favorites of the Clans, and as a breeding pair, will be well treated and used as biological weapon swarms, once a few dozen have been bred to adulthood.

[**Rust Monsters**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3hc2c5/rust_monster/) - Biff and Molly. They're good people. Favorite metals are copper and iron, respectively.

[**Crawling Claws**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3qbjiw/the_crawling_claw/) - These are the escaped familiars of a long dead mage who lived here decades ago. The claws live as a swarm now, huddling together for warmth and hunting in packs. They are viscous and tenacious, and once they detect prey, they will not stop attacking unless driven off by fire, acid or magic.

[**Roper**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/3eebqc/roper/) - The Roper is not coping. Most of its food has been siphoned off by the Hobgoblins, and there are too many to fight. Its considering leaving, but it knows the Hook Horrors are nearby, but does not know the surrounding terrain very well, and its hesitant to move blindly. Its been barely surviving on the occasional rodent that wanders into its chamber and will attack and substantial prey with a frightening ferocity.

[**Hook Horrors**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4ay0kd/hook_horror/) - This nest of 3 breeding pairs is starving to death. They are blocked off from the main system and have no access to fresh water or food. In a few days they will turn on one another. In a week the Hobgoblins will unblock the tunnel and collect the carapace to turn into non-reflective armor pieces.

[**Otyugh**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4aqi3u/otyugh/) - Happy as a Neo-Otyugh in shit. It lives in the Hobgoblin's midden and is well-treated by the Clans. Anything stupid enough to climb into its domain will be attacked without mercy.
